# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-Plagiarism-Detection

This Program aims to find out the plagiarsim in the set of available documents. These documents are submitted by the students for grading. The algorithm used to detect plagiarised documents is Min Hashing. The three steps involved here are 
-> Shingling (Creating k-word shingles)
-> Min-Hashing (Generating Hash functions and Siganture matrix)
-> Locality Sensitive Hashing (Identifying plagiarised documents by calculating Jaccard distance with b Bands and r rows)

In the end, which set of documents are plagiarised can be found out.
